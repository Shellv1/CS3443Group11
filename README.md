## Description

This application sorts members into groups based on alphabetical, experience, or random ordering.

## Functionality

The user enters size of teams, number of members total, and how to sort them. The user then enters a member name, their ID, and their experience. The members are then sorted based on the specified sort type and displayed.

## Known bugs:

- Sorting by experience doesn't work entirely optimally.
- Choosing multiple experience levels doesn't give user feedback in GUI.
