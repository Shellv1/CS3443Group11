## Purpose

The purpose of this teambuilder project is to create a GUI team randomizer, with a customizable number and size of teams. Balancing options based on experience, alphabetization, or pure randomization can also be selected.

### Known bugs:

- Sorting by experience doesn't work entirely optimally.
- Choosing multiple experience levels doesn't give user feedback in GUI.
